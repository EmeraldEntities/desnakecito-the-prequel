= INCOMING TRANSMISSION =

The primes have lost their staging grounds.
The creature itself seems to have disappeared.

All records of this creation will be destroyed.
As for the creature?

Maybe it'll come back again.
One day.

Captain Nivek Hpesoj, it's now your turn.
Lead the despaclan. 

Fortuna, ut inveniam gratiam in te. 
Exodium Gratifica.
